Feature: Stopwords should not interfere with search results (Stanford)
  I want search queries containing stopwords to return spectacular results with awesome relevancy, recall, and precision

Scenario: Stopwords in title searches should be ignored - 3 words total
  Given I am on the home page
  When I fill in "q" with "alice in wonderland"
  And I select "Title" from "search_field"

  Then I should get at least 100 total results
  And I should get the same number of results as a title search for "alice wonderland"
  And I should get more results than a title search for "\"alice in wonderland\""
